## Installation Instructions:

This requires express.js, node.js, mysql2 and inquirer. Open the terminal and begin with ```npm init``` followed by ```npm i``` to hopefully automatically install all required dependencies. If it fails, manually install each with  ```npm i express```, then ```npm i mysql2``` followed by ```npm inquirer```. ```npm node-echo``` is required for the fun ASCII art. As node modules are not included in this repo. This will allow for full functionality.

Run the program by opening your terminal in the main folder and typing ```node index.js```

## Usage:

To dynamically manage a database consisting of tables of departments, roles and employees. Has various CRUD features to view, add and remove from each table.
